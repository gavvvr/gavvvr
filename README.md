### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a well-grounded Kotlin/Java backend developer with 8 years of commercial experience.
For application development I prefer Kotlin now and would only use Java where I do not want to bring in `kotlin-stdlib` as a dependency.

- ðŸ“• I like reading books and I make notes using Obsidian to focus my attention on crucial tings
- ðŸŒ± When I have a time, I work on [Obsidian Imgur plugin](https://github.com/gavvvr/obsidian-imgur-plugin) here on GitHub
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m interested in:
  - any DevOps tools, which help me to automate my flow and deliver faster
  - Domain-Driven Design
  - practical functional programming techniques
  - asynchronous programming
  - monitoring and observability
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: git, testing, clean design, CI/CD, Gradle, Docker & Kubernetes and CLI tools
- ðŸ’» I work on MacBook ï£¿, [here](https://github.com/gavvvr/dotfiles) are my .dotfiles
- ðŸ“« You can find my contacts and CV [here](https://bit.ly/gavvvr-cv-github)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: "Simplicity is prerequisite for reliability"
